# Remote Desktop - How to connect?
## First we make following assumptions:
1. Remote computer is on and connected to internet.
3. You know the IP-address of the wireless modem the computer is connected to e.g. 176.68.210.159 which is the external IPv4-address. It might have changed, if so see errors below for how to solve the problem.

## What to do to connect?
1. Open "Remote Desktop" (Swedish: Anslutning till fjärrskrivbord).
2. Enter the public IP-address known.
3. Make sure to select "Use another user" (Swedish: Annan användare) option found at the bottom of the window that popped up.
4. Enter the username and password as found in a document called "BWSCComputer" in Teams.
6. Hit enter or click on "connect".
7. You are connected when you see the screen of the remote computer.

## Errors
1. Wrong password. Solution: Enter the correct password.
2. Wrong username. Solution: Enter the username that the computer has exactly as it displays it, you might need to be where the computer is for this unless specified above.
3. Wrong address. Solution: Go to the computer and check the public IP-address, or ask someone from the team that you know are where the computer is.
4. Certificate error. Solution: Accept and continue connecting.
5. Any other error. Solution: Google the error because it is probably not known here.
